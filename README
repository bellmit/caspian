## Configuring a Jenkins Job

**Execute shell**
  
```
# Define any extra gradle tasks and switches in build.env (example below)
cat <<EOF > ${WORKSPACE}/jenkins/build.env
EXTRA_GRADLE_TASKS="dockerPushAll publish"
EXTRA_GRADLE_SWITCHES="-PpublishUrl=build/publish -PdockerRegistry=<registry>"
EOF

${WORKSPACE}/jenkins/build.sh
```

**Inject environment** *(loads the version property to be used in the build description)*

* Properties File Path: `build/version.properties`

**Set Build Description**

* Description: `${version}`
